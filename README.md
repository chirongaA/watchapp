Welcome to Di Vittorio and Elena Jewelers!!üòç
Back in June 2025, I set out ot learn something new!! A new framework.To be more specific, Next.js.
I must say the journey has been nothing short of wonderful. From the extensive documentation to building an application from scratch. It's been fun, it's been different, it's been definitely a good learning experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
